        <h2><span class="icon">ℹ️</span> About Us</h2>

        <p>SBQuest is an online platform designed to help Indian users practice daily learning in a structured way. The platform combines educational value with a consistent daily routine. Every user receives tasks and offers in the morning and afternoon slots. This system helps users maintain a steady learning habit while earning reward points that can later be redeemed.</p>

        <p>Each user receives tasks and offers in the morning and afternoon slots. Each task contains a quiz that is carefully structured for engagement. Quizzes consist of multiple questions, and each question provides several answer choices. There are repeated questions in the quizzes to help users reinforce their knowledge.</p>

        <p>At SBQuest, points are called <strong>SB points</strong>. When users complete their daily tasks and offers and answer questions correctly, these points are credited to their account. The points are not just symbolic; they have real value. Users can view their balance in the wallet section. The wallet interface is simple and transparent—it shows the SB earned, pending redemptions, and approved withdrawals. This helps users track their progress clearly without confusion.</p>

        <p>One of the most useful features of SBQuest is the <strong>redeem request system</strong>. Once users collect enough SB points, they can place a request to convert those points into money. Redemption happens through UPI, which is fast, familiar, and widely used across India. Each request has a status, such as pending, approved, or rejected, so users always know where their money stands. This system is designed to be transparent and easy to follow.</p>

        <p>SBQuest also focuses on accountability and fairness. The platform ensures that tasks and offers are distributed evenly so all users get equal opportunities. Every task and offer resets daily, meaning that each new day brings a fresh set of challenges. This avoids monotony and keeps users active. The slot-based logic—morning and afternoon—helps maintain daily consistency and balanced participation.</p>

        <p>Educational content is at the core of SBQuest. Questions cover a wide variety of topics such as general knowledge, Indian history, geography, science, and world capitals. For example, users may encounter a question about the smallest country in the world, the capital of a nation, or a key figure from India’s freedom struggle. These topics are carefully selected to ensure that while answering, users learn something meaningful. Some questions also include images to make the experience more interactive.</p>

        <p>The simplicity of our design is also important. Users do not need technical knowledge or complicated steps to participate. Accessing daily tasks and offers, answering quizzes, and checking wallet balance can all be done smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices. This accessibility makes SBQuest friendly to students, professionals, and casual learners alike. Whether someone has a few minutes during a break or a dedicated study hour, they can easily use the platform.</p>

        <p>Our mission is straightforward: <strong>to make daily learning rewarding and accessible</strong>. By completing daily tasks and offers, users strengthen their memory, improve awareness, and build confidence in their knowledge. The reward system is meant to encourage consistency and discipline in learning. Even small rewards help motivate users to continue their daily practice and learning journey.</p>

        <p>SBQuest is a structured platform that connects learning with discipline and rewards. Our vision is to grow steadily by adding more question banks and improving the variety of quizzes. Even in its current form, SBQuest fulfills its goal of making learning a part of everyday life while ensuring users are rewarded for their efforts.</p>

        <p>Our platform offers a simple and engaging way to stay consistent. With slot-based daily tasks and offers, multiple-choice quizzes, wallet tracking, and UPI redemption, SBQuest proves that learning can be both educational and rewarding.</p>
