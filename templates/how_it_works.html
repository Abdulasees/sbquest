        <h2><span class="icon">⚙️</span> How SBQuest Works</h2>

  <p>
    SBQuest is designed to make daily learning and earning simple — no registration or login is required.
    Each visitor automatically receives a secure, anonymous <strong>Visitor ID</strong> stored in their browser session.
    This ID keeps track of all your completed tasks, daily offers, and wallet rewards without collecting any personal details.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Visit SBQuest:</strong> Open the website to begin — no signup or email needed. A unique visitor ID is automatically created for your session.</li>

    <li><strong>2. Complete Daily Tasks:</strong> Two sets of learning-based tasks are released each day in separate 12-hour slots. You can earn SB points by completing them correctly.</li>

    <li><strong>3. Participate in Daily Offers:</strong> Learning-based offers are also provided each day, similar to daily tasks. Each offer includes educational or question-based activities that reward you with SB points upon successful completion.</li>

    <li><strong>4. Earn and Track SB Points:</strong> All your rewards are securely recorded in the Wallet section, linked to your visitor ID — no account setup or personal data needed.</li>

    <li><strong>5. Redeem Your Rewards:</strong> Once you collect enough SB points, you can redeem them directly through <strong>UPI</strong>. No email, registration, or password required.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each visitor’s progress is stored locally using session data, ensuring full privacy and an easy, no-login experience.
    However, if you clear your browser data, cookies, or use a different device or browser, your <strong>Visitor ID</strong> will be reset, and your previous progress or wallet balance may no longer be available.
  </p>

  <p>
    SBQuest automatically manages new tasks and offers every 12 hours, keeping the platform dynamic, fair, and engaging for all visitors.
