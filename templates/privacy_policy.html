        <h1><span aria-hidden="true">🔒</span> Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 2025</p>

        <p>SBQuest is fully committed to maintaining a secure, transparent, and trustworthy digital learning environment. This Privacy Policy explains comprehensively the categories of information gathered, methods of processing, storage practices, and protective measures implemented when users interact with the SBQuest platform. The purpose of this policy is to ensure learners understand how their data is managed, fostering confident, informed, and uninterrupted use of platform features, quizzes, community resources, and educational tools.</p>

        <p>We are dedicated to maintaining operational integrity while respecting the privacy of every user. Every step of data collection, from registration to activity tracking, is performed with discretion and in accordance with legal obligations. Users can engage with the platform knowing that information is handled responsibly and securely, supporting a safe educational environment for individuals of diverse age groups and learning backgrounds.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>During registration, SBQuest collects only essential information required for proper platform functionality. This includes email addresses, chosen usernames, and optional profile details such as age range, learning preferences, educational history, subject interests, and skill levels. Gathering this information enables the platform to deliver customized quizzes, track progress, and provide appropriate content recommendations while avoiding excessive personal data collection.</p>

        <p>Beyond registration, activity-related insights are collected. These include completed quizzes, scores, time spent on each module, timestamps for participation, and content preferences. This behavioral data allows the platform to refine recommendations, monitor engagement, identify knowledge gaps, and optimize educational pathways. Importantly, this data is exclusively used internally and is never shared with external advertising partners.</p>

        <p>Technical and device-related information may also be recorded, such as browser type, device model, operating system, IP addresses, approximate geographic location, screen resolution, and session duration. This information enables cross-device compatibility, faster load times, and efficient troubleshooting. At no time is technical data linked to commercial profiles, sold, or used for marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Functional Tracking</h2>
        <p>SBQuest utilizes cookies and similar technologies to improve usability, maintain session continuity, and safeguard quiz responses. Functional cookies enable accurate answer recording, prevent data loss during interruptions, and preserve consistent platform behavior across sessions. These cookies also store preferences to ensure seamless interaction during repeated visits.</p>

        <p>Users may adjust cookie preferences via browser settings. Disabling essential cookies may disrupt critical functionality, including persistent login sessions, real-time progress tracking, and personalized content delivery. Retaining functional cookies is recommended for uninterrupted platform access. Occasionally, anonymized and aggregated statistics derived from cookies help the platform analyze trends without revealing individual identities.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>
        <p>SBQuest may display curated advertisements from trusted third-party providers, including Google AdSense. These services might collect limited information via cookies to serve contextually relevant advertisements based on general user interactions. SBQuest has no control over third-party data collection; users should consult their privacy policies for details. All advertisements are educationally aligned, non-intrusive, and carefully selected to complement learning experiences.</p>

        <h2>Usage of Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Authenticating user accounts and ensuring platform integrity</li>
            <li>Facilitating quiz participation, scoring, and progress reporting</li>
            <li>Monitoring operations, resolving errors, optimizing performance, and maintaining uptime</li>
            <li>Providing responsive and personalized user support</li>
            <li>Delivering content recommendations based on learning patterns</li>
            <li>Informing users about updates, features, announcements, and campaigns</li>
            <li>Performing research and analytics to enhance content quality and usability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Information is strictly used for operational purposes. SBQuest never sells, rents, or exchanges personal information for profit. Disclosure occurs only when legally required or necessary to resolve user support matters.</p>

        <h2>Account Management and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Users retain complete control over account data. Account deletion requests can be submitted at any time through profile settings. After confirmation, active data is permanently removed, while minimal encrypted backups may remain temporarily to preserve system integrity and prevent accidental data loss. These backups are purged according to privacy and security standards.</p>

        <p>Users are encouraged to periodically update profile details and notification preferences to ensure stored information remains accurate and relevant.</p>

        <h2>Security Practices</h2>
        <p>SBQuest employs advanced multi-layered security protocols to safeguard user information. These include encryption, secure authentication, firewalls, access control, continuous monitoring, regular audits, and incident response procedures. While no system guarantees absolute security, these practices significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, breaches, or information loss. Users should maintain strong passwords, avoid sharing credentials, and log out after each session.</p>

        <p>Security measures are continually updated to counter emerging threats. Vulnerabilities are promptly addressed, and users are informed about significant updates affecting their accounts. This proactive approach ensures safe interaction with quizzes, progress tracking, and platform features at all times.</p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>SBQuest is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Personal data from minors is not knowingly collected. Parents or guardians can contact support for immediate removal if a child’s information is accidentally submitted. The platform complies with applicable child protection laws and implements safeguards to maintain online safety for younger users.</p>

        <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect new platform features, technological improvements, additional educational content, or changes in legal compliance. Updates take effect immediately upon posting. Users should review this policy periodically to remain informed about data practices. Each revision aims to improve clarity, transparency, and adherence to evolving privacy standards.</p>

        <h2>User Rights and Transparency</h2>
        <p>SBQuest is committed to open communication regarding data handling. Users have the right to request information about collected data, corrections, or account deletion. All interactions, including registration, quizzes, and support communication, are managed with accountability. Users may request a summary of stored data to ensure trust and confidence in platform operations.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Information is retained only as long as necessary to provide services, meet legal obligations, or perform operational tasks. Obsolete, inactive, or redundant data is systematically removed. Periodic reviews ensure accuracy, relevance, and regulatory compliance.</p>

        <h2>Communication and Support</h2>
        <p>Support communications may include name, email, and inquiry details. This data is used solely for resolving issues and improving platform experience. Information is stored securely and never shared for marketing purposes. Strict internal privacy practices protect user confidentiality.</p>

        <h2>Platform Improvements and Analytics</h2>
        <p>SBQuest uses anonymized analytics to understand engagement patterns, optimize quizzes, and enhance content. Collected data is stripped of identifiable information and analyzed in aggregate, helping identify popular topics, detect knowledge gaps, and improve educational resources.</p>

        <h2>Advertising Transparency</h2>
        <p>All advertisements adhere to strict guidelines ensuring relevance, educational value, and non-intrusiveness. Third-party providers operate independently, and users should review their policies regarding ad-related data collection. SBQuest ensures ads do not interfere with learning, quizzes, or platform functionality.</p>

        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>Accessing SBQuest constitutes consent for collection, processing, and storage of data as described. Consent can be withdrawn at any time by deleting accounts or contacting support. Withdrawal does not affect prior legal obligations or actions.</p>

        <h2>Commitment to Responsible Data Handling</h2>
        <p>SBQuest emphasizes ethical data practices, secure operations, and safe educational experiences. Personal information is shared only when operationally or legally necessary. Regular review and improvements maintain security, reliability, and privacy standards. Users are educated about safe online behavior to encourage responsible digital engagement.</p>
