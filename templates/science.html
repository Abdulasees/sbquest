        <h2>Introduction to Science</h2>
        <p>
            Science is the systematic study of the natural world. It helps us understand matter, energy, life, Earth, and space. 
            By exploring physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, and astronomy, science explains how things work and why they behave as they do. 
            Studying science improves problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and curiosity, and provides a foundation for advanced learning in technology, medicine, and engineering.
