    <section class="topic" id="physics-basics">
    <h3>Physics – Motion, Forces, Energy, Electricity, Sound, and Light</h3>

    <div class="intro">
        Physics is the science that explains the natural world by studying how matter and energy interact. It encompasses motion, forces, energy transformations, electricity, sound, and light, providing the foundation for understanding the universe from the smallest particles to the largest celestial bodies. Physics helps explain phenomena ranging from falling objects and moving vehicles to the behavior of waves, electricity, and light in our daily life.
    </div>

    <div class="more" id="more-physics-basics">
        Motion is a central concept in physics, describing the change in position of objects over time. Isaac Newton formulated the three fundamental laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, explaining how objects move and how forces influence their trajectories. Galileo Galilei made crucial early observations, discovering that all objects accelerate equally under gravity and emphasizing experimentation as a method for understanding nature. Through these contributions, students can comprehend not only the movement of everyday objects but also the orbits of planets and the mechanics of machines.

        <br><br>
        Forces are responsible for altering motion, whether through push, pull, tension, friction, or gravity. Newton’s laws demonstrate that forces create acceleration and maintain equilibrium in physical systems. Later, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism, explaining how forces act at a distance and how energy can be transmitted through fields. Understanding forces allows us to build structures, design vehicles, and predict natural events like tides and earthquakes, showing the practical importance of physics in engineering and environmental studies.

        <br><br>
        Energy exists in multiple forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, and nuclear energy. James Joule’s experiments established the principle of energy conservation, showing that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed. Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity further revealed that energy and mass are equivalent, forming the basis of nuclear physics. This understanding explains how engines, power plants, and renewable energy systems operate, and why energy management is essential for technological progress and environmental sustainability.

        <br><br>
        Electricity, the flow of electric charges, powers almost every aspect of modern life. Benjamin Franklin explored the nature of lightning and electric charge, Alessandro Volta created the first battery to generate a steady current, and Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, enabling the generation of electricity on a large scale. Innovators like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison transformed electricity into practical applications, making lighting, communication, and industrial machinery possible. Electricity continues to drive modern civilization, connecting science, technology, and everyday convenience.

        <br><br>
        Sound, a mechanical wave, travels through solids, liquids, and gases, transmitting energy that can be perceived by hearing. Pythagoras first studied the mathematical relationships in musical tones, while Ernst Chladni analyzed vibrations on surfaces to understand acoustic patterns. Sound physics explains resonance, echo, and wave interference, influencing the design of concert halls, instruments, and audio technology. Understanding sound waves also contributes to medical imaging, sonar systems, and communication technologies, linking physics to real-world innovations.

        <br><br>
        Light is both a wave and a particle, forming the basis of optics and modern photonics. Isaac Newton explored reflection, refraction, and dispersion, demonstrating how light interacts with different materials. James Clerk Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory described light as an electromagnetic wave, while Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect showed light’s particle-like behavior. Knowledge of light enables technologies such as microscopes, telescopes, lasers, fiber-optic communications, and imaging devices, revolutionizing science, medicine, and communication globally.

Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, and Niels Bohr revealed subatomic structures, including electrons, protons, and neutrons, which clarified the behavior of elements and the mechanisms of bonding.

        <br><br>
        Molecules, the combinations of two or more atoms, determine the properties and interactions of substances. Amedeo Avogadro proposed that equal volumes of gas contain the same number of molecules, leading to the concept of Avogadro’s constant. Understanding molecular composition allows chemists to predict reactions, synthesize new materials, and develop pharmaceuticals. The diversity of molecular arrangements explains why different compounds display distinct characteristics and functions in biological, industrial, and environmental contexts.

        <br><br>
        Chemical transformations involve the rearrangement of atoms to generate new substances. Antoine Lavoisier, considered the pioneer of modern chemistry, demonstrated that matter is neither created nor destroyed during reactions, establishing the conservation principle. Later, Dmitri Mendeleev created the periodic table, identifying recurring patterns among elements and predicting undiscovered ones. Chemical processes govern everything from energy production to food preparation, industrial manufacturing, and pollution management, highlighting their central role in civilization.

        <br><br>
        Elements represent the simplest forms of matter that cannot be decomposed chemically. Early researchers, including Robert Boyle and Lavoisier, cataloged numerous elements and described their distinct properties. Mendeleev’s arrangement revealed relationships among atomic masses and chemical characteristics, laying the foundation for contemporary understanding. Modern classification relies on atomic number, electron configuration, and reactivity, forming the basis for predicting interactions, constructing compounds, and designing innovative materials.

        <br><br>
        Everyday substances, from water and air to metals, polymers, and ceramics, demonstrate chemistry’s practical relevance.
