    <h3>Time Zones and How the Earth’s Rotation Affects Day and Night</h3>

    <div class="intro">
        Time zones and the cycle of day and night are directly related to the Earth’s rotation on its axis. As the planet rotates, different regions experience sunlight and darkness at varying times, creating the natural rhythm of day and night. Understanding this concept is essential for navigation, communication, global coordination, and comprehending the relationship between the Earth’s movement and human activity.
    </div>

    <div class="more" id="more-time-zones">
        The Earth completes one full rotation approximately every 24 hours, causing the Sun to appear to rise in the east and set in the west. This rotation means that when it is daytime in one part of the world, it is nighttime on the opposite side. Time zones were developed to standardize time across regions, allowing people to coordinate activities, schedules, and transportation in a systematic way. Sir Sandford Fleming, a Canadian engineer, proposed a worldwide system of time zones in the 19th century, which eventually became the foundation of the system used today.

        <br><br>
        The globe is divided into 24 standard time zones, each generally covering 15 degrees of longitude. Local time within each zone is synchronized with the position of the Sun relative to the central meridian of the zone. Adjustments such as daylight saving time are applied in some countries to make better use of daylight during certain seasons. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) serves as a global reference point, ensuring consistency in timekeeping for international travel, communication, and commerce.

        <br><br>
        Understanding time zones is critical for activities that span multiple regions, including aviation, shipping, broadcasting, and global business operations. It allows individuals to schedule meetings, flights, and communication across countries with minimal confusion. Furthermore, knowledge of the Earth’s rotation and time zones helps explain natural phenomena such as sunrise and sunset timings, seasonal changes, and the length of daylight in different latitudes.

        <br><br>
        The study of day and night cycles also has practical applications in astronomy, meteorology, and environmental science. It explains the variation in temperature, weather patterns, and human activity schedules. For example, regions near the poles experience extreme variations in daylight during summer and winter, while equatorial areas maintain relatively consistent day lengths throughout the year. These differences influence agriculture, energy use, and cultural practices worldwide.

        <br><br>
        By studying time zones and the Earth’s rotation, learners develop a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of natural processes and human systems. They gain skills in calculating time differences, interpreting global maps, and understanding how the position of the Sun affects daily life. This knowledge highlights the balance between planetary motion and human activity, providing insight into the rhythms of life across the globe.
