    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>By accessing or using SBQuest, you agree to follow these Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, you should discontinue using the platform immediately.</p>

    <h3>1. User Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Users must provide accurate registration details and maintain only one account. Multiple accounts can exist, but each account is independent and not connected to others.</li>
        <li>Users may only participate in tasks and offers available on the platform. Public sample quizzes are for demonstration purposes only and do not award SB points.</li>
        <li>Posting advertisements, spam, or unrelated content is strictly prohibited. Users cannot post anything on the platform; all communication must be through the official contact page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Rewards & Payments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SB points earned through tasks and offers are credited to the Wallet section on your dashboard in real-time.</li>
        <li>Points can be redeemed only via the approved payment method (UPI). SBQuest is not responsible for any third-party errors outside of the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Platform Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Users must respect the platform and other users by only interacting with tasks, offers, and official sample quizzes for demonstration.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to manipulate the system, use unauthorized tools, or interfere with platform operations. SBQuest reserves the right to suspend accounts if such activity is detected.</li>
        <li>SBQuest may update tasks, offers, or reward structures without prior notice. Users are responsible for reviewing updated terms regularly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Fair Play & Compliance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All tasks and offers are designed for honest participation. Maintain integrity to ensure a fair experience for all users.</li>
        <li>Users must comply with applicable laws while using the platform. Illegal or unethical activities will result in immediate account suspension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>SBQuest is not responsible for technical issues, service interruptions, or third-party content (such as ads). While we aim to provide uninterrupted service, we do not guarantee 100% uptime or error-free operation.</p>
    <p>SBQuest is not responsible for any errors, delays, or problems caused by third-party services, including payment providers used for SB point redemptions.</p>

    <h3>6. Modifications</h3>
    <p>SBQuest reserves the right to modify or update these Terms & Conditions at any time. Continued use of the site after changes indicates acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h3>7. Contact</h3>
    <p>If you have questions about these terms, you may contact us through the official <a href="/contact/">Contact Page</a>. Users cannot post publicly; all inquiries must go through this contact method.</p>
