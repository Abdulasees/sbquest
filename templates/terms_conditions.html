    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>By accessing or using SBQuest, you agree to follow these Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, you should discontinue using the platform immediately.</p>

    <h3>1. User Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Users can freely access and participate in the tasks, offers, and quizzes available on SBQuest without the need for login or registration.</li>
    <li>Each visitor automatically receives a unique <strong>Visitor ID</strong> that tracks their progress, rewards, and participation during their session.</li>
    <li><strong>However, if you clear your browser data, cookies, or use a different device or browser, your Visitor ID will be reset, and your previous progress or wallet balance may no longer be available.</strong></li>
    <li>Posting advertisements, spam, or unrelated content is strictly prohibited. Users cannot upload or post anything directly on the platform; all communication must go through the official Contact Page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Rewards & Payments</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>SB points earned through eligible tasks and offers are recorded and processed automatically by the system.</li>
    <li>Points can be redeemed only via <strong>UPI</strong>, which is the sole payment method supported by SBQuest. The platform is not responsible for any third-party errors or delays outside its control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Platform Rules</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Users must interact with SBQuest only for its intended purpose — completing tasks, viewing offers, and participating in quizzes.</li>
    <li>Any attempt to manipulate the system, use unauthorized tools, or interfere with normal operations may result in permanent restriction from the platform.</li>
    <li>SBQuest holds every right to change, modify, or update the points system, rewards structure, or available tasks at any time without prior notice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Fair Play & Compliance</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>All tasks and offers are meant for honest participation. Users must act ethically and follow the stated instructions for each task or offer.</li>
    <li>Use of SBQuest must comply with all applicable laws. Any misuse, fraud, or illegal activity will lead to permanent blocking of access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>SBQuest is not responsible for any technical issues, interruptions, or third-party content such as ads. While we aim to keep the service running smoothly, we do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>
    <p>SBQuest is not liable for any issues caused by external services, including payment gateways or advertisement networks used on the platform.</p>

    <h3>6. Modifications</h3>
    <p>SBQuest reserves the right to update or modify these Terms & Conditions at any time. Continued use of the site after changes indicates acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
