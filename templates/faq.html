Mobile-friendly design ensures quizzes, explanations, and interactive content load quickly, allowing learners to study anytime and anywhere without the need for additional apps.</p>
        <p>Tip: For uninterrupted study sessions on mobile, ensure a stable internet connection and avoid multiple tabs running heavy content simultaneously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>5. Do I need an account to access quizzes?</strong> Yes. Creating an account allows learners to safely track progress, save results, and unlock full quizzes. Accounts also enable personalized features like daily reminders, suggested topics, and a dashboard to monitor learning over time.</p>
        <p>Tip: Use a valid email and a strong password for account creation. This ensures safe access and protects your progress from being lost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>6. Are there limits on daily quizzes?</strong> Some quizzes may have limits to maintain fair usage and platform stability. Limiting attempts encourages learners to focus and read questions carefully, promoting thoughtful engagement rather than random guessing.</p>
        <p>Tip: Plan your daily quizzes strategically. Attempt the ones that align with your learning goals first, and revisit missed topics later for deeper understanding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>7. Is SBQuest only for India?</strong> The platform is primarily designed for Indian learners, with quizzes reflecting local curriculum topics, general knowledge, and awareness-based content relevant to India. However, learners from other countries may also benefit from the quizzes on general subjects, critical thinking, and cross-disciplinary knowledge.</p>
        <p>Tip: International learners can focus on global topics like science, math, and logic puzzles while exploring Indian history or geography for cultural awareness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>8. How safe is my data?</strong> SBQuest collects only essential details such as email and username for account creation. All information is stored securely and handled according to the SBQuest Privacy Policy. No personal information is shared with third parties without consent.</p>
        <p>Tip: Avoid sharing sensitive information outside the platform and regularly review your privacy settings for added security.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>9. Can I retake a quiz?</strong> Each quiz is designed for a single attempt to ensure fairness and accuracy in tracking knowledge. This approach encourages learners to focus on reading questions carefully and applying concepts correctly the first time.</p>
        <p>Tip: Take notes during quizzes to remember key points for future learning, even if retaking the quiz is not allowed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>10. What topics do quizzes cover?</strong> Quizzes cover a variety of subjects including general knowledge, science, mathematics, history, geography, and current affairs.

    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>11. Do quizzes have a fixed time?</strong> Some quizzes include time limits, which appear clearly before the start. Timed quizzes help simulate real-world scenarios, develop focus under pressure, and improve speed in solving questions.</p>
        <p>Tip: For untimed quizzes, take your time to read questions carefully, but try to complete them in a focused session to maintain concentration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>12. Do I need any books or materials?</strong> No external resources are needed. SBQuest provides all necessary information on-screen. Mini-lessons, hints, and explanations accompany quizzes to help learners understand topics fully.</p>
        <p>Tip: For deeper study, learners may supplement with books or online articles, but SBQuest alone is sufficient for daily practice and knowledge building.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>13. Can multiple people use the same account?</strong> No. Each user should create a separate account. Sharing accounts can cause progress tracking errors, duplicate entries, and technical issues. Individual accounts ensure accurate performance monitoring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>14. Can I create more than one account?</strong> No. Multiple accounts for a single user violate platform rules and may result in restricted access. Consistent use of one account ensures proper tracking of learning and achievements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>15. What happens if I face a technical issue?</strong> Report issues via the Contact page. The SBQuest support team addresses login problems, quiz errors, or content loading issues promptly.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>16. Why can’t I see the quiz?</strong> This may happen if you are logged out, your device has connectivity issues, or the quiz window has expired. Refresh the page after logging in, or check your internet connection to resolve the problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>17. Why was my access restricted?</strong> Restrictions may apply if platform rules are violated, such as creating multiple accounts, using automated tools, or bypassing quiz steps. These measures maintain fairness and integrity for all users.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>18. How often are quizzes updated?</strong> Quizzes are refreshed daily to provide fresh questions and encourage consistent practice. Daily updates ensure learners have continuous learning opportunities without repetition.</p>
        <p>Tip: Check the platform every day to explore new topics, practice regularly, and track improvement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>19. Can I use SBQuest without internet?</strong> No. A stable internet connection is required for quizzes to load and submit answers. Offline access is not currently supported.</p>
