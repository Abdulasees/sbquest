    <h2><span class="icon"></span>Community Guidelines</h2>
    <p>SBQuest is designed as a safe and productive platform where users can complete Daily Tasks and Offers to earn SB points. Our Community Guidelines exist to ensure every user has a clear understanding of how to use the platform correctly, maintain fairness, and keep the experience safe and enjoyable for everyone. Unlike social forums, SBQuest does not allow user-generated content, posting, or discussions; the platform is strictly read-only outside of task and offer participation.</p>

    <p><strong>Participation Rules:</strong> Users can only engage with tasks and offers provided on their dashboard. Points are awarded exclusively for completing these tasks correctly and following any instructions included with the offer. Sample quizzes are available to demonstrate the type of questions users may encounter, but they are not interactive and do not provide SB points. Users cannot submit answers outside the designated task workflow, and no other form of content submission is allowed anywhere on the site.</p>

    <p><strong>Account Safety and Security:</strong> Each account is personal and non-transferable. Users must protect their login credentials and avoid sharing their account with others. SB points are tied to individual accounts and can only be redeemed through the Wallet section, ensuring secure and accurate tracking of earned rewards. Any attempt to manipulate the system, including using multiple accounts or unauthorized automation, is strictly prohibited and may result in point adjustments or account suspension.</p>

    <p><strong>Prohibited Activities:</strong> As SBQuest is not a forum or social platform, users cannot post questions, comments, advertising, or any other content. Contacting the platform for support, feedback, or inquiries must be done exclusively through the Contact option available on the dashboard. Any attempt to bypass these rules or misuse platform features will be treated as a violation of the guidelines and may result in account restrictions or suspension.</p>

    <p><strong>Points and Rewards Transparency:</strong> SB points earned from tasks and offers are immediately reflected in the Wallet section of the dashboard. Users can track their real-time balance, view completed tasks, and redeem points through secure methods such as UPI. The system is fully transparent, ensuring that users understand how points are awarded and how they can be redeemed safely. This promotes trust and fairness across all users.</p>

    <p><strong>Daily Engagement:</strong> Users are encouraged to check Daily Tasks and Offers consistently to maximize SB point earnings. While sample quizzes are available for demonstration purposes, they do not contribute points. Users should focus on the real tasks and offers available in their dashboard, completing them according to the given instructions to ensure accurate rewards.</p>

    <p><strong>Respect and Compliance:</strong> Users are expected to follow all platform rules, including using the site solely for completing tasks and offers, not attempting to cheat or bypass the system, and avoiding any form of spam or unauthorized activity. SBQuest reserves the right to monitor usage patterns and enforce guidelines to protect the integrity of the platform and the fairness of point distribution.</p>

    <p><strong>Support and Contact:</strong> Any questions, concerns, or technical issues should be reported only through the Contact option in the dashboard. Users should not attempt to interact with other users for help, as the platform does not provide user-to-user communication features. All support requests are handled directly by the SBQuest team to ensure accurate guidance and safe handling of any issues.</p>

    <p>By following these Community Guidelines, users can ensure a smooth, fair, and secure experience on SBQuest. Participation in tasks and offers becomes straightforward, transparent, and rewarding. Users who adhere to the rules will enjoy uninterrupted access to SB point rewards and the full benefits of the platform.</p>
