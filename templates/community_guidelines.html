        <h1>SBQuest Community Guidelines</h1>
        <h2>Safe and Fair Participation</h2>

        <p><strong>SBQuest</strong> provides a focused and reliable space for daily quizzes. These guidelines help maintain a safe environment where users participate responsibly and enjoy a smooth learning experience. Every point listed here is created to support clarity, fairness, and proper use of the platform.</p>

        <p>All users are expected to follow the rules and interact with SBQuest in a respectful and responsible manner. These guidelines not only protect the platform from misuse but also help ensure that everyone receives the same clean, simple, and uninterrupted experience.</p>

        <h2>Participation Rules</h2>
        <p>Before attempting any quiz, users should read the displayed instructions carefully. Each quiz is provided directly by SBQuest, and only these officially released quizzes should be attempted. The platform does not accept external questions, user-submitted quizzes, or uploaded materials in any form.</p>

        <p>Every quiz is part of a simple daily routine that is easy to understand and follow. Users should complete activities as they appear on the screen, without altering the flow or interacting with the system in unintended ways.</p>

        <h2>Usage and Safety</h2>
        <p>A valid logged-in account is required to access quizzes. This prevents unauthorized usage and helps maintain safety for all users. Your account should always be used responsibly, and login details must be kept private to avoid misuse.</p>

        <p>Users must not use scripts, automated tools, third-party extensions, or any manipulation to interfere with how the platform operates. Such actions affect fairness and may disrupt the experience for others. SBQuest reserves the right to restrict access if suspicious or harmful behavior is detected.</p>

        <h2>Daily Engagement</h2>
        <p>SBQuest encourages regular participation to help users maintain a steady learning routine. Quizzes appear in a simple, predictable format that does not create pressure or confusion. This helps users engage at their own pace and build a consistent habit.</p>

        <p>Even though participation is encouraged, users should never force the system to reload quizzes or jump between screens in unusual ways. Smooth and natural usage ensures that the platform runs cleanly for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Respect and Compliance</h2>
        <p>All users are expected to follow the platform rules exactly as described. Attempts to cheat, exploit, or bypass the intended quiz flow are considered violations. These actions harm the fairness of the system and interfere with other users’ learning experience.</p>

        <p>SBQuest automatically monitors activity patterns to detect irregular behavior. This helps maintain a balanced environment where everyone participates honestly and fairly. Users should always approach the platform with integrity.</p>

        <h2>Appropriate Behavior</h2>
        <p>Users must use SBQuest responsibly and avoid behavior that may harm or interfere with the platform. Actions such as creating multiple accounts, misusing login access, or attempting to replicate quiz screens in unintended ways are not allowed.</p>

        <p>Any deliberate act that disrupts the quiz process—such as manipulating responses, refreshing repeatedly, or using the system in a way not meant for normal operation—will be considered a violation. These guidelines exist to keep the experience smooth for all participants.</p>

        <h2>Content Integrity</h2>
        <p>All quiz content on SBQuest is created and structured to support simple daily learning. Users should engage with this content as it is presented and avoid copying, modifying, or republishing it elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Reproducing questions on other platforms, sharing quiz formats, or distributing the structure of quiz sessions without permission is not allowed. Maintaining content integrity protects the platform and ensures that all users have equal access to clean, original material.</p>

        <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>Users are responsible for keeping their account information secure. Passwords should remain private, and users should avoid logging in on untrusted devices. Personal information is collected only when necessary for account access.</p>

        <p>If suspicious activity occurs—such as unauthorized login attempts or unusual account behavior—users should immediately contact support. Reporting issues quickly helps keep the platform secure and stable for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Responsible Device Usage</h2>
        <p>To avoid interruptions during quizzes, users should ensure their device, browser, and internet connection are working properly. Errors may occur if the page is refreshed repeatedly or accessed through unsupported methods.</p>

        <p>Stable participation helps maintain consistent quiz performance. Avoid switching tabs, force-closing the browser, or using private/incognito windows in ways that may disrupt the flow of the quiz.</p>

        <h2>Platform Integrity</h2>
        <p>SBQuest is designed with a simple and steady structure. Every quiz follows a planned schedule, and users must not attempt to interfere with this timing. Any manipulation of timestamps, quiz loading behavior, or access restrictions is strictly prohibited.</p>

        <p>The platform actively reviews system behavior to preserve fairness and stability. These measures ensure that all users receive the same smooth and transparent experience every day.</p>

        <h2>No User-to-User Communication</h2>
        <p>SBQuest does not provide options for users to message or communicate with each other. This prevents misinformation and helps maintain a safe environment where participation remains focused and controlled.</p>

        <p>All support and communication should occur only through the official contact page. This ensures that every response is accurate, secure, and consistent with platform policies.</p>

        <h2>Support and Assistance</h2>
        <p>If users face any difficulty—whether related to login, quiz access, or general usage—they should contact SBQuest support through the official page. The team provides safe and direct assistance when needed.</p>

        <p>Support exists to help users resolve issues calmly and effectively. Following these guidelines ensures that both users and support staff can handle concerns smoothly and responsibly.</p>
