    <h2><span class="icon"></span>Community Guidelines</h2>

    <p>SBQuest is designed as a safe and productive platform where users can complete Daily Tasks and Offers to earn SB points. These guidelines ensure that everyone uses the platform properly and that all participation remains fair, transparent, and secure. SBQuest does not allow user-generated content, posting, or discussions — all interactions happen only through the structured task and offer system.</p>

    <p><strong>Participation Rules:</strong> Users may only interact with the official tasks and offers displayed on the site. Points are credited solely for completing these tasks accurately and as instructed. No external submissions, uploads, or personal inputs are required or accepted beyond the structured participation flow.</p>

    <p><strong>Usage and Safety:</strong> SBQuest does not require login, registration, or personal accounts. All user interactions occur directly through the platform’s available pages. Users should follow task and offer instructions exactly as shown and avoid any third-party tools or manipulations. Any misuse of the system or repeated violations may result in loss of earned points or access restrictions.</p>

    <p><strong>Prohibited Activities:</strong> Since SBQuest is not a forum or social platform, users cannot post messages, comments, advertisements, or any other type of content. Communication with the platform for support, feedback, or questions must only be made through the official Contact Page. Any attempt to misuse this feature or submit unrelated content may lead to access restrictions.</p>

    <p><strong>Points and Rewards Transparency:</strong> SB points earned from completing tasks and offers are reflected directly in the Wallet section. Users can track their available balance and redeem points through secure payout methods such as UPI. The system ensures full clarity on how points are earned, displayed, and redeemed, maintaining fairness for all participants.</p>

    <p><strong>Daily Engagement:</strong> Users are encouraged to check available Daily Tasks and Offers regularly to maximize their earnings. All available opportunities are displayed clearly, and users should complete them according to the given instructions to ensure proper crediting of points.</p>

    <p><strong>Respect and Compliance:</strong> Users are expected to follow all platform rules, including using the site solely for its intended purpose of completing tasks and offers. Any attempts to cheat, exploit, or bypass the system are not permitted. SBQuest reserves full rights to monitor activities and enforce actions to preserve platform integrity.</p>

    <p><strong>Support and Contact:</strong> For any assistance, technical issues, or general questions, users should use the official Contact Page. SBQuest does not allow user-to-user communication, ensuring that all inquiries are handled safely and directly by the support team.</p>

    <p>By following these Community Guidelines, users help maintain a fair, transparent, and secure environment where completing tasks and offers remains rewarding and reliable for everyone.</p>
