  <h2>What is SBQuest?</h2>

  <p>
    SBQuest is an educational website that publishes detailed articles
    across Science, History, Geography, and General Knowledge.
    The platform is designed to help readers understand concepts clearly
    through structured, topic-focused explanations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each subject area on SBQuest contains dedicated articles that focus on
    one topic at a time. Science articles explain physics, biology, chemistry,
    earth science, and space topics. History articles explore major events,
    civilizations, and global developments. Geography content covers physical,
    human, and environmental topics, while General Knowledge focuses on
    global facts, records, and important information.
  </p>

  <p>
    All articles are fully visible, written in simple language, and organized
    to support students, exam aspirants, and curious learners. SBQuest avoids
    hidden content and presents information in a clear, scrollable format.

  <h2>Featured Science Article</h2>
  <p>
    Physics is the branch of science that explains how the natural world works
    by studying matter, energy, space, and time. It helps us understand why
    objects move, how forces act on them, how energy is transferred, and how
    phenomena such as electricity, sound, and light shape our daily experiences.
    From the falling of a leaf to the functioning of smartphones and satellites,
    physics provides the fundamental rules that govern all physical processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The importance of physics extends far beyond classrooms and laboratories.
    Its principles are applied in transportation, construction, medicine,
    communication, sports, and environmental science. When we ride a bicycle,
    cook food, listen to music, or use electrical devices, we are interacting
    with physical laws. Learning basic physics concepts strengthens logical
    thinking, encourages curiosity, and builds a strong foundation for advanced
    studies in science, engineering, and technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Physics also plays a key role in problem-solving and innovation. By
    understanding cause-and-effect relationships in physical systems, humans
    have been able to invent machines, improve safety, and develop technologies
    that enhance quality of life. Studying physics is not only about formulas
    and theories; it is about understanding the behavior of the universe in a
    meaningful and practical way.

  <h2>Featured History Article</h2>
  <p>
    World War I, also known as the Great War, was one of the most significant
    and destructive conflicts in modern history. It lasted from 1914 to 1918
    and involved many of the world’s leading nations, mainly based in Europe
    but with global participation. What began as a regional crisis soon expanded
    into a worldwide war due to complex political alliances and rising
    international tensions. The conflict caused immense human suffering,
    reshaped national borders, and permanently altered political, social, and
    economic systems across the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before 1914, Europe was experiencing rapid industrial growth, expanding
    empires, and increasing competition between powerful nations. While there
    had been periods of peace, these years were marked by rivalry, suspicion,
    and preparation for conflict. When war finally broke out, it introduced a
    new level of destruction made possible by modern technology and mass
    mobilization. The effects of World War I continued long after the fighting
    ended, influencing global affairs for decades.
  </p>
  <p>
    The causes of World War I were not sudden or accidental. Instead, the war
    resulted from a combination of long-term factors that gradually destabilized
    Europe. One of the most important causes was militarism. Many European
    countries believed that strong military power was necessary to protect
    national interests and maintain influence. Governments invested heavily in
    armies and navies, leading to an arms race, particularly between Germany
    and Great Britain.

  <h2>Featured Geography Article</h2>
  <p>
    The Earth experiences a wide variety of climates and weather patterns due to differences
    in latitude, altitude, ocean currents, and atmospheric circulation. Understanding these
    patterns is essential for agriculture, urban planning, disaster preparedness, and
    environmental management. Climate and weather shape ecosystems, influence human settlement,
    and affect global economies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Climate refers to the long-term patterns of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind
    in a region, while weather describes short-term conditions. By studying climate zones
    and weather systems, scientists can predict natural hazards, support sustainable
    development, and understand environmental change over time. Tropical climates occur near
    the equator, typically between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. These regions
    experience high temperatures year-round, abundant rainfall, and high humidity. Tropical
    climates are home to rainforests, savannas, and coral reefs, supporting extraordinary
    biodiversity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dry climates are characterized by low precipitation, extreme temperatures, and limited
    vegetation. Deserts, semi-arid steppes, and savannas experience high evaporation rates
    and scarce rainfall, making these regions vulnerable to water scarcity and desertification.
    Understanding the differences between tropical and arid regions helps humans adapt,
    manage resources, and maintain ecological balance. Studying climate zones is also vital
    for predicting extreme weather events, such as monsoons, hurricanes, or droughts, which
    can have significant impacts on society and the environment.

  <h2>Featured GK Article</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding world capitals and their countries is an essential aspect of global geography.
    Capitals serve as the administrative, political, and cultural hubs of nations, hosting
    government institutions, international embassies, and key economic centers. Learning about
    capitals helps in understanding global affairs, travel, trade, and cultural diversity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Capitals vary in size and function. Some are sprawling metropolises, like Tokyo or London,
    while others are smaller yet strategically important, such as Brasília or Reykjavik. Asia,
    the largest continent, hosts capitals such as Beijing, Tokyo, and New Delhi, blending
    governance with culture, commerce, and innovation. African capitals like Cairo, Nairobi,
    and Abuja reflect historical legacies and modern development, balancing tradition with
    contemporary governance.
  </p>
  <p>
    European capitals, including London, Paris, and Berlin, showcase political power, historical
    heritage, and international diplomacy. In North America, Washington, D.C., Ottawa, and
    Mexico City act as centers of governance, culture, and economic activity. South American
    capitals like Brasília, Buenos Aires, and Lima balance urban growth with cultural identity.
    Capitals in Oceania and research hubs in Antarctica further illustrate the global diversity
    and importance of administrative and cultural centers. Studying world capitals improves
    travel skills, general knowledge, and understanding of international relations, trade,
    and cultural exchange.
