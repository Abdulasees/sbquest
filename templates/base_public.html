<!-- About Us -->
<div class="box">
    <h2><span class="icon">‚ÑπÔ∏è</span>About Us</h2>
    <p>SBQuest was created with a mission to help Indian users engage in productive online learning while earning meaningful rewards. In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, many platforms fail to motivate users to practice regularly or provide consistent incentives. SBQuest addresses this gap by combining task completion, educational challenges, and a transparent rewards system into a single gamified experience designed to make learning fun, interactive, and rewarding.</p>
    <p>Our platform is suitable for students preparing for competitive exams, professionals seeking to enhance their skills, or anyone who wants to improve general knowledge and cognitive abilities. SBQuest offers a wide range of tasks and quizzes covering subjects such as general knowledge, history, geography, mathematics, science, language skills, current affairs, and practical life skills. Every task is carefully curated to ensure that users not only earn points but also acquire valuable knowledge that can be applied in academics or daily life.</p>
    <p>To encourage daily engagement, SBQuest incorporates gamification elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards. Users can track their progress, view completed tasks, and understand how points are awarded. This transparent system fosters trust, builds confidence, and motivates users to complete tasks consistently. Daily challenges provide bonus points and recognition, helping users develop a disciplined routine that reinforces knowledge and builds long-term learning habits.</p>
    <p>Security and fairness are central to the SBQuest philosophy. All personal information is encrypted and handled responsibly, ensuring users‚Äô privacy is never compromised. Points earned can be redeemed securely through UPI, giving users tangible rewards for their effort. Every transaction and point calculation is transparent, making the platform reliable and user-friendly.</p>
    <p>The educational value of SBQuest extends beyond mere points and rewards. Each quiz and task is designed to teach or reinforce concepts effectively. For example, geography tasks help users memorize world capitals, Indian states, and important landmarks. History challenges cover major events such as India‚Äôs freedom struggle, cultural milestones, and notable personalities. Science and mathematics tasks strengthen analytical and problem-solving skills. Language quizzes enhance vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. This multi-dimensional approach ensures that learning is comprehensive, practical, and enjoyable.</p>
    <p>Community engagement is another key feature of SBQuest. Users can participate in public quizzes, challenges, and leaderboards, which foster a collaborative and competitive learning environment. Our community guidelines ensure a safe, respectful, and supportive space for all participants. By interacting with peers, sharing strategies, and discussing solutions, users not only learn faster but also develop teamwork and communication skills.</p>
    <p>SBQuest is committed to making education accessible, rewarding, and interactive. Our platform provides an inclusive environment where learners of all ages can improve their knowledge, sharpen their skills, and earn rewards for consistent effort. Whether a user wants to explore new subjects, prepare for exams, or simply challenge themselves with daily quizzes, SBQuest offers an intuitive interface and engaging content to meet these needs.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to empower Indian users to build confidence, knowledge, and lifelong learning habits. Our vision is to become the most trusted platform for micro-learning and task-based rewards, helping users grow personally and professionally. By integrating gamification, high-quality educational content, and secure rewards, SBQuest transforms online learning into a motivating, enjoyable, and rewarding experience. Join us to make learning a daily habit, earn tangible benefits, and connect with a community that values knowledge, effort, and growth.</p>
