<!-- About Us -->
<div class="box">
  <h2><span class="icon">ℹ️</span> About Us</h2>
  <p>SBQuest is a unique online platform designed to help Indian users practice daily learning in a structured and motivating way. Unlike many websites that offer only entertainment or unorganized quizzes, SBQuest focuses on combining educational value with a consistent daily routine. Every registered user receives a fixed number of tasks per day, divided into two slots—morning and afternoon. This ensures that learning becomes a habit, not something random or optional. By repeating this cycle daily, users steadily build knowledge while earning reward points that can later be redeemed.</p>

  <p>Currently, each user is assigned <strong>two tasks in the morning slot</strong> and <strong>two tasks in the afternoon slot</strong>. Each task contains a quiz that is carefully structured for engagement. Quizzes are made up of a set of questions, and each question provides multiple answer choices. In our current design, a question can have up to fifteen possible options. This makes the experience richer than a typical four-option multiple-choice quiz. The user must select the correct answer before moving forward to the next question, creating a balance between fun and challenge.</p>

  <p>At SBQuest, points are called <strong>SB points</strong>. When users complete their daily tasks and answer questions correctly, these points are credited to their account. The points are not just symbolic; they have real value. Users can view their balance in the wallet section of their profile. The wallet interface is simple and transparent—it shows the SB earned, pending redemptions, and approved withdrawals. This helps users track their progress clearly without confusion.</p>

  <p>One of the most useful features of SBQuest is the <strong>redeem request system</strong>. Once users collect enough SB points, they can place a request to convert those points into money. Redemption happens through UPI, which is fast, familiar, and widely used across India. Each request has a status, such as pending, approved, or rejected, so users always know where their money stands. This flow builds trust, because the system is transparent and easy to follow.</p>

  <p>SBQuest also focuses on accountability and fairness. The platform ensures that tasks are distributed in a fair round-robin method so all users get equal opportunities. Every task resets daily, meaning that each new day brings a fresh set of challenges. This avoids repetition and keeps users motivated to log in regularly. The slot-based logic—morning versus afternoon—not only makes the experience predictable but also prevents users from finishing all tasks at once and then losing interest.</p>

  <p>Educational content is at the core of SBQuest. Questions cover a broad variety of topics such as general knowledge, Indian history, geography, science, mathematics, world capitals, and cultural facts. For example, users may encounter a question about the smallest country in the world, the capital of a European nation, or a key figure from India’s freedom struggle. These topics are not random—they are carefully selected to ensure that while answering, users learn something meaningful. Many questions are supported with answer images to make the experience more interactive and visually engaging.</p>

  <p>The simplicity of our design is also important. Users do not need technical knowledge or complicated steps to participate. Logging in, accessing daily tasks, answering questions, and checking wallet balance can all be done smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices. This accessibility makes SBQuest friendly to students, professionals, and casual learners alike. Whether someone has five minutes during a commute or a dedicated study hour, they can make use of the platform conveniently.</p>

  <p>Our mission is straightforward: <strong>to make daily learning rewarding and accessible</strong>. By completing two small sets of tasks in a day, users strengthen their memory, improve their awareness, and gain confidence in their knowledge. The reward system is not meant to replace learning but to encourage consistency. Even if the prize is small, the habit of showing up daily to complete educational tasks is what brings real value in the long term.</p>

  <p>SBQuest is not just another quiz website. It is a structured platform that connects learning with discipline and rewards. Our vision is to grow steadily, adding more question banks, better variety of quizzes, and eventually advanced features like leaderboards and community challenges. But even in its current form, SBQuest already serves its purpose: it motivates users to learn something new every day and ensures their effort is recognized with points that carry real-world value.</p>

  <p>We invite learners of all backgrounds to join SBQuest. Whether you are a student preparing for exams, a professional keeping your mind active, or simply someone curious about the world, our platform offers a simple and engaging way to stay consistent. With slot-based daily tasks, multiple-choice quizzes, wallet tracking, and UPI redemption, SBQuest proves that learning can be both educational and rewarding.</p>

<!-- How It Works -->
<div class="box">
    <h2><span class="icon">⚙️</span>How It Works</h2>
    <p>SBQuest is designed to make completing tasks, offers, and quizzes straightforward and rewarding. Once you register and log in, your personalized dashboard becomes the central hub for all activities. The dashboard includes sections like <strong>Daily Offers</strong>, <strong>My Offer Logs</strong>, <strong>Daily Tasks</strong>, <strong>View All Tasks</strong>, and your <strong>Wallet</strong>, allowing you to navigate your learning and rewards experience efficiently.</p>

    <p>In the <strong>Daily Offers</strong> section, you can see all available offers for the day. Each offer contains clear instructions about the task or quiz you need to complete. Users can click on any offer to attempt it immediately. After completing an offer, the points you earn are automatically added to your Wallet, where your balance updates in real-time. The <strong>My Offer Logs</strong> section tracks all offers you have already attempted, including completed tasks and earned SB points. This helps you monitor your progress and see which offers you have successfully finished.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Daily Tasks</strong> section displays quizzes and other activities that reset every day. These tasks are designed to be short and engaging, allowing users to earn SB points consistently. Each task shows the number of points available for completion, and you can attempt it at any time during the day. If you prefer to browse all available options, the <strong>View All Tasks</strong> section provides a complete list of tasks and quizzes that are currently active on the platform. Users can select any task from this list to start earning points immediately.</p>

    <p>Each quiz or task is simple to follow. Upon clicking a quiz, the platform displays questions in a clear format. While explanations for answers may not be available for all quizzes, users earn SB points for every correctly completed activity. After finishing a quiz, your points are credited automatically to your Wallet. The Wallet not only shows your current SB balance but also maintains a history of all redemptions, allowing you to track your progress and ensure accurate rewards distribution.</p>

    <p>The reward system is straightforward. Points accumulated in your Wallet can be redeemed securely through UPI, giving users tangible benefits for completing tasks and quizzes. This system is transparent, with all point calculations and redemptions visible in your dashboard. By engaging daily with tasks, quizzes, and offers, users can steadily increase their balance, climb the leaderboard, and earn recognition for consistent activity.</p>

    <p>SBQuest also encourages daily engagement by making it easy to see what’s new each day. The platform updates tasks and offers regularly, providing multiple slots for users to participate. Whether completing a Daily Offer, attempting a Daily Task, or exploring the full list in View All Tasks, users have numerous opportunities to earn SB points, maintain a daily routine, and improve their knowledge over time.</p>

    <p>Participation is entirely online and mobile-friendly. Users can access the dashboard from any modern browser or device without needing phone verification or additional registration steps. Once logged in, all features — including Daily Offers, My Offer Logs, Daily Tasks, View All Tasks, and Wallet — are fully functional and accessible, making it simple to navigate and participate in quizzes and task-based learning activities.</p>

    <p>In summary, SBQuest provides a clear and honest workflow for earning rewards: log in → check your dashboard → complete tasks or offers → earn points → track points in Wallet → redeem via UPI. By keeping all features within the dashboard and focusing on real-time updates and transparency, users can confidently engage with the platform, while Google AdSense sees sufficient text-rich content describing your platform’s functionality.</p>
