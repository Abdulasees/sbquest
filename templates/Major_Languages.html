<h1>Major Languages of the World and Their Speakers</h1>

<p>
Language is one of the strongest expressions of human identity. It allows people to share ideas, preserve culture, pass down traditions, and build relationships across generations. Around the world, thousands of languages are spoken, each shaped by history, geography, and social interaction.
